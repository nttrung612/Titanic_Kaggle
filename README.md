# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

This repository contains my solution to Kaggle's [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic) competition. The objective is to predict the survival of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in the deaths of 1,502 out of 2,224 passengers and crew. This project aims to analyze the passenger data to predict which individuals were likely to survive.

## Data Description

The dataset includes various features such as:

- `PassengerId`: Unique identifier for each passenger
- `Survived`: Survival indicator (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- `Pclass`: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- `Name`: Passenger's name
- `Sex`: Gender
- `Age`: Age in years
- `SibSp`: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- `Parch`: Number of parents/children aboard
- `Ticket`: Ticket number
- `Fare`: Passenger fare
- `Cabin`: Cabin number
- `Embarked`: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Feature Engineering

To enhance the predictive power of the model, the following features were engineered:

- **Title Extraction**: Derived titles from passenger names to capture social status.
- **Family Size**: Combined `SibSp` and `Parch` to create a `FamilySize` feature.
- **Age Imputation**: Filled missing age values using median ages grouped by `Title` and `Pclass`.
- **Fare Binning**: Categorized fare into discrete intervals.
- **Cabin Indicator**: Created a binary feature indicating the presence of a cabin.

## Modeling Approach

Several machine learning models were evaluated:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

After hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation, the Gradient Boosting Classifier provided the best performance.

## Results

The final model achieved an accuracy of **XX.XX%** on the test set, as evaluated by Kaggle's submission system.

## Usage

To reproduce the results:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-kaggle-competition.git
   cd titanic-kaggle-competition
